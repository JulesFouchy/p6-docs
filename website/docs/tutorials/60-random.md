*p6* comes with quite a few random functions. For example, to pick a random number between 0 and 1, use `p6::random::number();` and to pick a random number between 3 and 7 use `p6::random::number(3.f, 7.f);`.

You can also pick random points and random directions. To see the complete list, see [the Reference](/reference/random).
